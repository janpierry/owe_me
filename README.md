## 🧭 About the Project

**OweMe** is a small personal project I built to practice my Flutter development skills. While I often find myself manually tracking small debts and credits between friends or family, I thought it would be a nice bonus to automate that process with an app.

The main goal of this project, though, was to explore mobile app architecture, state management, and local data persistence in a more structured and hands-on way.

It’s still in development, but it already covers the basic functionality I had in mind.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Manage Debtors**  
  Keep a list of people who owe you or whom you owe.

- **Log Records**  
  Add debts (they owe you), credits (you owe them), and payments (of their debt).

- **View Balances**  
  See the current balance for each person and a global total.

- **Transaction History**  
  View a list of all records for each debtor for better tracking and accountability.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technologies Used

OweMe follows **Clean Architecture** combined with the **BLoC pattern** to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

### Layers Overview
- **Presentation**: UI components (pages, widgets), BLoCs for state management, drafts, and mappers.
- **Domain**: Core business logic with use cases, entities, and repository interfaces.
- **Data**: Repositories, data sources, models, and adapters that handle persistence.

### Application Flow
User interaction begins in the **presentation layer**, where widgets communicate with BLoCs through events and states.  
BLoCs handle business logic by invoking **use cases** in the **domain layer**.  
The **domain** remains independent, defining repository interfaces that the **data layer** implements to keep dependencies pointing inward, following the Dependency Inversion principle.  
Finally, the **data layer** interacts with the local database using `sqflite`, and in the future, will integrate with remote APIs.

</p>

### Tech Stack
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (presentation, domain, data)
- **State Management**: `flutter_bloc`
- **Local Database**: `sqflite`
- **Dependency Injection**: `get_it`
- **Unit Testing**: `flutter_test`, `mocktail`
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Language**: Dart

## 📚 Challenges & Learning Journey

Although I was already familiar with Clean Architecture and BLoC, this was my first time working with `sqflite` for local data persistence. I learned how to:

- Set up a local database
- Create and manage tables
- Perform CRUD operations

It was a great learning experience and gave me more confidence working with local storage in Flutter.

## 🛠️ Current Status & Roadmap

### ✅ What Works:
- Adding and managing debtors
- Adding, editing, and deleting debts, credits, and payments
- Viewing balances and record history

---

### 🔧 Next Steps to MVP:
- [ ] Add error handling

---

### 🚀 Future Ideas:
- [ ] Add visual charts for balance trends
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Add integration with Firebase Crashlytics
- [ ] Implement filters for the record list
- [ ] Polish the UI for better usability
- [ ] Add remote storage
- [ ] Improve test coverage
