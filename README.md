## 🧭 About the Project

**OweMe** is a small personal project I built to practice my Flutter development skills. While I often find myself manually tracking small debts and credits between friends or family, I thought it would be a nice bonus to automate that process with an app.

The main goal of this project, though, was to explore mobile app architecture, state management, and local data persistence in a more structured and hands-on way.

It’s still in development, but it already covers the basic functionality I had in mind.

  See the current balance for each person and a global total.

- **Transaction History**  
  View a list of all records for each debtor for better tracking and accountability.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technologies Used

This app follows a Clean Architecture structure, using the following tools and technologies:

- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (domain, data, presentation separation)
- **State Management**: BLoC Pattern using `flutter_bloc`
- **Local Storage**: `sqflite`
- **Dependency Injection**: `get_it`
- **Unit Testing**: `flutter_test` and `mocktail`
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Language**: Dart

This layout helps organize the code and keep responsibilities separate.

## 📚 Challenges & Learning Journey

Although I was already familiar with Clean Architecture and BLoC, this was my first time working with `sqflite` for local data persistence. I learned how to:

- Set up a local database
- Create and manage tables
- Perform CRUD operations

It was a great learning experience and gave me more confidence working with local storage in Flutter.
